# My Learning Journey! {.unnumbered}

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Welcome to my learning diary, where I will reflect on my weekly engagement with course content, readings, and practical materials using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/books) in R. Each book will highlight key insights and applications of the concepts discussed, capturing what I have learned and found interesting each week. The structure of my diary includes a **summary** of the weekly material, an exploration of how these concepts have been **applied** in literature or policy, and personal **reflections** that contextualize the skills and knowledge gained, considering their relevance and potential future applications based on my interests.

My name is Norah Alhosain, and I am from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. I joined this master's program with the goal of enhancing my knowledge and building on my existing experience. For about three years, I have been considering pursuing a master's degree and actively searching for a relevant program. When I found that UCL was merging the Smart Cities and Urban Analytics with Spatial Data Science and Visualization programs, I felt confident that this was exactly what I was looking for. I have a background in computer science and several years of work experience at an advisory think tank in Riyadh, focusing on energy, sustainability, and economics. In my role, I’ve done lots for spatial analysis spatial analysis, particularly in transportation and network optimization, but I haven’t yet explored remote sensing in depth. This gap fuels my enthusiasm to learn and enhance my expertise in this area through this program. Here are some visual results from my previous analyses, which primarily focus on transportation challenges in Riyadh.
