# Overview {.unnumbered}

Welcome to my learning diary, where I will reflect on my weekly engagement with course content, readings, and practical materials using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/books) in R. Each book will highlight key insights and applications of the concepts discussed, capturing what I have learned and found interesting each week. The structure of my diary includes a **summary** of the weekly material, an exploration of how these concepts have been **applied** in literature or policy, and personal **reflections** that contextualize the skills and knowledge gained, considering their relevance and potential future applications based on my interests.
